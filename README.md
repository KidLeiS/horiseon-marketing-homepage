## Description

Welcome to the homepage of Horiseon marketing services!

We are an innovating marketing agencies with a mission to empower entrepeneurs and small businesses to utilise the power of digital marketing to supercharge their business. We wish to use this website to share our experience in digital marketing with a broader audience.

We have created a series of articles on digital marketing concepts such as SEO and social marketing as a free teaching resource in order to acheive this goal.

## Methodology

I refactored the code provided by my colleagues at edX Boot Camps by:
1. Changing html <div> and other non-semantic elements to semantic elements (and editting the CSS accordingly)
2. Adding semantic elements where necessary (i.e. the footer element)
3. Consolidating the CSS classes/ids
4. Adding alt attributes to images and icons
5. Reorganising the folder and removing unneeded files
6. Writing the new Readme
